        <h2>✨ Founder’s Message</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Magic Math Master — where passion and precision come together to build success in mathematics.</p>

        <h3>Founder’s Story</h3>
        <p>
          I was raised in a family with limited means, yet I developed a deep love for mathematics and a strong habit of self-study.
          Although I worked hard, I did not always have access to high-quality expert guidance to help me reach my full potential.
          These early challenges shaped my purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          I founded Magic Math Master to create opportunities for children who are curious and capable, but may not have the resources
          or support to advance. My goal is to make high-quality mathematics education more accessible through personalised teaching,
          small-group learning, and flexible support options for families.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe every motivated child deserves the chance to learn deeply, think confidently, and follow their dreams.

        <p>
          As the founder of Magic Math Master, it is my great pleasure to offer an Australian curriculum–aligned mathematics program designed
          to help students build confidence, master foundational skills, and reach their full potential. Whether a child’s goal is to catch up at
          school, extend beyond the classroom, prepare for university, or simply enjoy the beauty of numbers, I am here to support them every step
          of the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over several decades of teaching, researching, and parenting, I’ve learned that true mathematical understanding goes far beyond
          memorising formulas. Mathematics is a universal language of logic and creativity. It helps us make decisions, design technology,
          understand data, and solve complex problems in the real world. People with strong logical thinking and good maths skills often have
          better opportunities for success, although many other skills also play an important role. I believe every child can appreciate this
          “magic” when it is taught clearly, patiently, and in a way that connects to their life.
        </p>

        <h3>📘 My Teaching and Education Background</h3>
        <p>
          My passion for teaching began early, when I was still a student myself. Throughout primary and high school, I often helped friends
          understand mathematics more clearly during break time or before class; at times, small groups would even gather at my home so I could
          explain concepts in a calm, simple, and engaging way or help them understand the mathematical background needed to complete their assignments.
          During my undergraduate studies, I continued tutoring around 15 students in both one-to-one and small-group sessions.
        </p>

        <p>
          During that time, I also tutored a Grade 9 student who had fallen far behind in mathematics and at risk of repeating the year.
          After being tutored by me for a few weeks in the third term, he picked up most of the basic background knowledge required.
          By the end of Grade 9, he had become one of the top students in his class for mathematics. With ongoing support, he went on to achieve high
          scores in his final year of high school and later pursued a degree in Information Technology. This experience reinforced my belief that with
          targeted guidance and encouragement, every student can overcome challenges and succeed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later, while studying at La Trobe University in Australia, I provided personalised tutoring for five undergraduates and three high school students.
          Even after completing my Bachelor’s degree, I continued to support a small number of children from friends’ families—helping them catch up in
          mathematics and develop independent study skills—despite being busy with advanced coursework.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Professionally, I have taught mathematics and related subjects in both Vietnam and Australia, including:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>🏫 Saigon University (formerly Ho Chi Minh City College of Education)</li>
          <li>🏫 University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (School of Finance)</li>
          <li>🏫 Dang Khoa High School</li>
          <li>🏫 The International School in Saigon (TIS)</li>
          <li>🏫 Raffles Vietnam</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I also served as a teacher-training lecturer at Saigon University, preparing future secondary mathematics teachers.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked as the Research and Marketing Leader at the Centre for Economics Sciences Application and Investigation, collaborating with foreign investors
          to localise product design and research for the Vietnamese market. This experience strengthened my analytical thinking, communication skills, and ability
          to connect theory with real-world applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to teaching, I applied my mathematical background to engineering and completed a PhD in Engineering at the University of Melbourne.
          I currently work for an Australian government organisation, where I develop and test tracking algorithms using mathematical modelling, logical reasoning,
          and MATLAB programming. My research publications demonstrate how I use mathematics to derive new formulas and improve existing algorithms to solve real-world
          problems in engineering, industry, and defence.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my PhD, I also taught large-group tutorials, and shortly after completing my doctorate, I was invited to be a guest lecturer in Applied Mathematics
          at the University of Melbourne.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have taught students from Prep to Year 12, as well as university students, and I have supervised and mentored more than
